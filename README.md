## Produce Shop

This is an example E-Commerce project built in React with a modern UI including a dark mode toggle. It features authentication through Firebase Auth API. This site enables a user to add produce items to a shopping cart, remove them, and checkout and "pay" with a fake credit card number. Checkout is only available to users who are currently logged in, to simulate a real E-Commerce store.
